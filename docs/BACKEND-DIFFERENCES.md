## Features

| Feature | idb | mapepire |
|---|---|---|
| **Keepalive** | Automatically disabled (no WebSocket) | Supported (ping via `VALUES 1`) |
| **JDBCOptions `libraries`** | SQL naming: `SET SCHEMA` (first lib only); system naming: `setLibraryList()` (all libs) | Native JDBC support (same behaviour) |
| **JDBCOptions `naming`** | Mapped to `setConnAttr(SQL_ATTR_DBC_SYS_NAMING)` | Native JDBC support |
| **JDBCOptions `transaction isolation`** | Mapped to `setConnAttr(SQL_ATTR_COMMIT)` | Native JDBC support |
| **JDBCOptions `auto commit`** | Mapped to `setConnAttr(SQL_ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT)` | Native JDBC support |
| **JDBCOptions `date format` / `date separator`** | Mapped to `setConnAttr(SQL_ATTR_DATE_FMT / SQL_ATTR_DATE_SEP)`; defaults to `iso` / `/` when unset | Passed through to JT400; rm-connector-js injects `iso` / `/` defaults when unset |
| **JDBCOptions `time format` / `time separator`** | Mapped to `setConnAttr(SQL_ATTR_TIME_FMT / SQL_ATTR_TIME_SEP)`; defaults to `iso` / `:` when unset | Passed through to JT400; rm-connector-js injects `iso` / `:` defaults when unset |

| **Default commitment control** | `SQL_TXN_NO_COMMIT` set explicitly (required for LOB column operations) | No commitment control by default |
| **`SET OPTION` statements** | Not allowed (use `setConnAttr` instead) | Supported via JDBC |
| **Credentials** | Optional (`creds: { user?, password?, database? }`). Defaults to `*LOCAL` with current user profile. `database` is an RDB directory entry name (see `WRKRDBDIRE`). | Required (`host`, `user`, `password`) |

## Libraries Behaviour by Naming Mode

The `libraries` JDBCOption behaves differently depending on the `naming` mode:

| Naming | Behaviour | Unqualified table resolution |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `'sql'` (default) | First library becomes the **default schema** | Only searches the first library |
| `'system'` | All libraries added to the **job library list** (`*LIBL`) | Searches all libraries in order |

Under SQL naming, additional libraries beyond the first are not searchable via unqualified references — use fully qualified names (e.g. `QIWS.QCUSTCDT`) or switch to system naming. Both backends now implement this consistently.

## Binary size limits

Both backends surface binary columns (`BINARY`, `VARBINARY`, `BLOB`) as Node
`Buffer`, and both accept `Buffer` as a bound parameter. How large a value can
flow through each path differs significantly.

### Measured ceilings

These round-trip figures (insert + select) were measured on a single-partition
Power system against IBM i 7.5 with the gated sizing parity test. Re-run
against your own deployment to measure the ceilings on your network, server,
and client combination:

```sh
RM_RUN_SIZING=1 npm run test:parity -- --testNamePattern="BLOB-sizing"
```

| Size    | idb insert / select | mapepire insert / select |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 KiB   | 9 ms / 6 ms         | 8 ms / 18 ms             |
| 64 KiB  | 7 ms / 2 ms         | 18 ms / 36 ms            |
| 1 MiB   | 36 ms / 2 ms        | 387 ms / 574 ms          |
| 8 MiB   | 378 ms / 28 ms      | 3.0 s / 3.7 s            |
| 16 MiB  | 760 ms / 86 ms      | 4.4 s / 5.1 s            |
| 24 MiB  | 1.1 s / 0.6 s       | 7.0 s / 13.2 s           |
| 32 MiB  | 1.5 s / 1.0 s       | **FAIL** (WS cap)        |
| 128 MiB | 11.7 s / 4.8 s      | —                        |

- **idb**: round-trips cleanly at every size tested, including 128 MiB. The
  upper bound is driven by Node heap and `Buffer.constants.MAX_LENGTH` rather
  than the driver.
- **mapepire**: round-trips cleanly up to 24 MiB. 32 MiB fails with WebSocket
  close code 1009 "Resulting message size [52436992] is too large for
  configured max of [52428800]" — the server-side 50 MiB message cap. Since
  mapepire wraps the binary value in a lowercase hex string (2× size) inside a
  JSON envelope, the practical per-row ceiling is roughly 24 MiB of binary.

### Why the two backends behave differently

- **idb backend**: `Buffer` is passed through `Statement.bindParameters` to the
  native DB2 CLI driver, and returned directly on reads. The wrapper
  defensively copies each `Buffer` parameter before binding to work around
  memory-safety bugs in idb-connector's native parameter binding (tracked
  upstream as [IBM/nodejs-idb-connector#202](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-idb-connector/issues/202);
  fix in progress). Without the copy:
  - the first 16 bytes of the caller's `Buffer` are overwritten with CLI
    length-indicator bytes at every size tested (8 B upward) — the server-side
    row is correct, but the caller's `Buffer` is silently clobbered after the
    call;
  - a payload of ~1 MiB causes a deterministic `SIGSEGV` during INSERT; and
  - larger payloads occasionally come back corrupted in the middle of the
    buffer (and on the server-side row), at a 16-byte window roughly 1 MiB
    before the end of the payload.
  The defensive copy fully neutralises the first two; the third is an
  additional upstream symptom the copy doesn't cover. See
  `examples/blob-sizing-idb.js` for a standalone reproduction.
- **mapepire backend**: every binary value goes through a lowercase hex-string
  intermediate in both directions. This introduces three limits:
  - **V8 `String::kMaxLength`** — roughly ~512 MB on 32-bit Node and ~1 GB on
    recent 64-bit Node. Because hex is 2× the byte size, the hard per-value
    ceiling is ~256–512 MB even if the WebSocket cap were lifted.
  - **Memory amplification** — during conversion the `Buffer`, the hex string,
    and the encoded JSON payload all live in memory simultaneously, so peak
    RSS is roughly 3–4× the payload size.
  - **WebSocket message size** — mapepire's server imposes a 50 MiB maximum on
    inbound messages (observed as close code 1009 on 32 MiB BLOB inserts).

Neither backend exposes a streaming LOB API — result sets are read fully into
memory. For callers that need BLOBs larger than the mapepire ceiling, either
use the idb backend (when running on IBM i) or plan for a future streaming
initiative.
